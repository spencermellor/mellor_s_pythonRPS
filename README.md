# Rock Paper Scissors - Python text-based take on a classic!

Pick your weapon and play against the computer - you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

Prerequisites: all you need is Python 3 to play

Clone the project, cd to your directory / download, and run on the game.py file in a Python3 Terminal window for Mac / Linux, or the powershell for Windows

The rules are the same as the classic
1. Paper covers Rock
2. Scissors cuts Paper
3. Rock smashes Scissors

Choose your weapon wisely!

Built with Python3
